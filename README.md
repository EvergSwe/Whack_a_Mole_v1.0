## Introduction

Playing digital games has become one of the most popular leisure activities for people of all ages, genders and backgrounds. But it has more advantages but leasure as training the different capabilities like
reducing reaction time without compromising accuracy. This is discussed in this publication from 2009 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2871325/). On the basis of this input I decided to develop
an easy click game known as "whack a mole" for my second project using html, css and javascript syntax. The game has two levels of difficultis based on how long time the mole is visable before it moves to a randome
new square in the grid and scores are collected based on number of hits e.g. "click" a mole.
